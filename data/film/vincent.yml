  Olivia and Vincent are on a first date in a cozy café in their neighborhood. In a subtle manner, they try to find out what the other’s intentions are. It soon appears that they both have a different goal. Vincent is after a night of casual sex, whereas Olivia is looking for a serious relationship. She is convinced that she can distinguish between the right and the wrong man by refusing to go to bed with him on the first night. This strategy might trigger some complicated situations though.
